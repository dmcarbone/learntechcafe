## Welcome to _LearnTechCafe_
This is our very first post. It’s all about helping you **build your own blog for free**! What’s more is, there’s no ads, and no trials. The only “catch”? You need a willingness to learn! So follow along with this series and build yourself a clean, professional website to get your thoughts and ideas out there for the world to see, all while saving you money!

## Why start a blog?
Have you always wanted to start a blog, just to get your thoughts out there? Maybe you want to:
- Share your tech journey
- Do book reviews
- Build a personal digital portfolio
- Create a personal, digital workspace
- Or just learn how to build a website in general?

focus on wellness, a professional resume, or maybe just have a website just to play around and dump your thoughts into, like a digital journal? And of course, all for free? I’m sure you’ve search it on Google of ChatGPT: ‘how to make a blog for free’. Now I’ll level with you. There _are_ many free options out there. However, most of these options are either free trials, or have caveats associated with the, for example, reduced features or containing ads, (making you blog much uglier).

<br>

Sure you can pay to remove ads. Sure, you can pay to have a fancy web-site builder like WordPress do the work for you. But these are expensive times we live in! I’m telling you now, **you can** **build a live, free, beautiful and zero-ad** blog, for not a single cent, as long as you’re willing to follow this tutorial, and learn a little bit of web-development skills!
