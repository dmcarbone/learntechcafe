## Welcome to _LearnTechCafe_
This is our very first post. It’s all about helping you **build your own blog for free**! What’s more is, there’s no ads, and no trials. The only “catch”? You need a willingness to learn! So follow along with this series and build yourself a clean, professional website to get your thoughts and ideas out there for the world to see, all while saving you money!

## Why Start a Blog?
Have you always wanted to start a blog, just to get your thoughts out there? Maybe you want to:
- Build a personal portfolio
- Write and share book reviews
- Share your tech journey
- Create a personal, digital workspace
- > 🤖 To create a tech-teaching blog?
- Or just learn how to build a website in general?

If you've ever gone to Google and typed something like:
> - "How to start a blog for free"
> - "Best free blogging platform"
> - "Is WordPress free?"

Then you've probably run into the same problem I did. That is:
**Most "free" blogging options aren't really free**.

## What's the Catch with Most "Free" Blogging Platforms?
These "free" platforms either have:
- A limited-time trial
- Reduced features
- Visually displeasing ads
- Ugly branding you can't remove
- All of the above
In order to remove some of the above features, you likely need to pay to upgrade.

Sure, platroms such WordPress, Wix or Squarespace let you setup a blog with ease. However, with this ease, comes a cost - either a cost in money, performace, or control. Yes, many people use these services. And that's perfectly fine! You can get a professional blog up and running quickly with any one of these services. However...

## What if you Could Build a Blog That
- **Is 100% free**
- **Is 100% ad-free**
- **Has lightning fast loading speeds**
- **Fully under your control**
- **Privacy friendly and ethical**
We're here to tell you that this is 100% possible! There are other bloggin solutions available, especially if you want to save money, increase performance, and have much greater control over your blog - as long as your're curious and willing to get hands-on and  learn how to build and take control of your own blog.

## What You'll Learn in this Tutorial Series
We'll teach you how to use four main tools to build your blogging website.
1. **Hugo** - A free tatic site generator to create you website and site content (including code)
2. **GitHub** - A place to store your site content and code for free
3. **Netlify** - A service that hosts your site online, for free
4. _Bonus_ How to purchase a custom domain.

> 🤖 _**ZZZT** Purchase a custom domain?_

Yes, A.B.A2, purchase. This is the only piece of the whole puzzle that costs money - if you wish to have a custom domain (like learntechcafe.com), you must purchase it. Luckily, this is optional. If you walk through this process with us, you will be set up with a live, free domain - you just can't customize it unless you buy your own domain. Look for a **Bonus** post at the end of this series for how to set up a custom domain for your blog!

With the above tools, you'll:
- Write your posts in simple Markdown, a basic coding language to make it easy to write site content
- Publish your posts to GitHub
- Automatically deploy your posts to the web, instantly.

It's actually really cool once you get it running!

Yes it takes some learning.
No, it's not drag-and-drop like WordPress.
Don't worry, you won't be required to become a fancy web-develope, knees deep in code!

By the end of this series, you'll have a **fully functional blog** that:
- Loads super fast compared to most paid blog platforms out there
- Doesn't track or advertise to your readers
- Costs you nothing but a domain name (optional)
- Belongs 100% to you
