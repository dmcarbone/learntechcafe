## Meet the Hosts

### Dan Carbone

Author and creator of *Learn Tech Cafe* blog. Through this blog I seek to deepen my own knowledge of computers, software, coding, and more. I'm a spatial data analyst by trade - but don't let that intimidate you! Iâ€™m a life-long learner diving into the digital realm and share my beginner-friendly lessons with you as I go.

### Robo
My robot companion and co-host, expanding his horizons from his humble beginnings as a barista and digital cafe owner.
> ðŸ¤– *I was programmed to do one thing - serve coffee at affordable prices.*

Robo has generously agreed to let us rent space in his digital cafe, Roboâ€™s Coffee Corner, for use as a hub for curiosity and learning!
