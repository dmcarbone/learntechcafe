Do you have a willingness to learn? Then ask yourself, are you:
- Curious about computers?
- Budgeting while building digital skills?
- Bent on building a blog?
- Keen to crack keyboard shortcuts?
- Daring to deep dive into data?
- Contemplating coding... code?
- And more?

Then look no further! Join A.B.A2 and me as we explore the wide world of computer technology, and hopefully teach you (and ourselves) a little something along the way!

**Let's build digital skills on a budget.**

## Meet the Hosts

### Dan Carbone

Author and creator of *LearnTechCafe*. I'm a spatial data analyst by trade - but don't let that intimidate you! While I do have formal training in spatial data analysis, the rest of my path into tech was paved with curiosuty, coffee and plenty of trial and error. Iâ€™m a life-long learner diving into the digital realm and sharing my beginner-friendly, cost-saving lessons with you as I go.

This blog is my experiment - a place where I document my cost-saving discoveries, share computer tidbits, and a variety of how-to guides for others. My goal is to make computers feel a little less intimidating, a lot more empowering, and save you money while I'm at it. Thanks for joining me on this journey!

### A.B.A2 (Advanced Barista Automton, version 2)
