Have you always wanted to start a blog, just to get your thoughts out there? Maybe you want to:\nBuild a personal portfolio Write and share book reviews Share your tech journey Create a personal, digital workspace ü§ñ Document and track caffeine consumption publically\nOr just learn how to build a website in general? If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever gone to Google and typed something like:\n\u0026ldquo;How to start a blog for free?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Best free blogging platform\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Is WordPress free?\u0026rdquo; Then you\u0026rsquo;ve probably run into the same problem I did. That is: Most \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; blogging options aren\u0026rsquo;t really free.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the Catch with Most \u0026ldquo;Free\u0026rdquo; Blogging Platforms? These \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; platforms either have:\nA limited-time trial Reduced features Visually displeasing ads Ugly branding you can\u0026rsquo;t remove Or all of the above To remove some of these features, you need to pay to upgrade.\nSure, platforms such WordPress, Wix or Squarespace let you setup a blog with ease. However, with this ease, comes a cost - either in money, performace, or control. Yes, many people use these services. And that\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine! You can get a professional blog up and running quickly with any one of these services.\nBut what if I told you that\u0026hellip;\nYou Can Build a Free Blog Not only can you build a 100% free blog, but it\u0026rsquo;s also:\n100% ad-free Privacy friendly and ethical Lightning fast Fully under your control - no company can take down your posts Did I mentioned 100% free? We\u0026rsquo;re here to tell you that this is not only possible, but completely doable! There are other blogging solutions available, especially if you want to save money, increase performance, and have much greater control over your blog - as long as you\u0026rsquo;re curious and willing to get hands-on and learn how to build and take control of your own blog. We\u0026rsquo;re here to show you one of those solutions.\nWhat You\u0026rsquo;ll Learn in this Tutorial Series We\u0026rsquo;ll teach you how to use four main tools to build your blogging website.\nHugo - A free tatic site generator to create your website and site content using simple code Visual Studio Code - A free software program ideal for working with code GitHub - A place to store your site content and code for free Netlify - A service that hosts your site online, for free Bonus - We\u0026rsquo;ll also show you how to purchase a custom domain using Netlify. ü§ñ *ZZZT Purchase a custom domain?\nYes, A.B.A2, purchase. This is the only piece of the whole puzzle that costs money - if you wish to have a custom domain (like learntechcafe.com), you must purchase it. Luckily, this is optional. If you walk through this process with us, we\u0026rsquo;ll set you up with a live, free domain - you just can\u0026rsquo;t customize it unless you buy your own domain. We\u0026rsquo;ll get to that later in this series!\nWith the above tools, you'll: - Write your posts in simple Markdown, a basic coding language to make it easy to write site content - Publish your posts to GitHub - Automatically deploy your posts to the web, instantly. It\u0026rsquo;s actually really cool once you get it running!\nYes it takes some learning - but no, it\u0026rsquo;s not overwhelming. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not drag-and-drop like WordPress.
