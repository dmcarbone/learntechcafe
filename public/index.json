[{"content":"Create-a-Free-Blog — Part 3 Welcome back! In Part 2, we built your blog locally using Hugo. Today, you\u0026rsquo;re going to publish it live on the internet — completely free, and with zero ads — using GitHub and Netlify.\nLet’s go live.\nWhat You’ll Need A GitHub account (free) A Netlify account (also free) Your Hugo blog folder (from Part 2). In this tutorial this folder is named myblog An internet connection Create a GitHub Repository GitHub will act as the storage for your blog\u0026rsquo;s source code. Here’s how to create a repository (repo).\nLog into GitHub, click the + button, then click New repository Name it anything you\u0026rsquo;d like, in this tutorial the repository is named myblog. Leave it public Add a description if you\u0026rsquo;d like. Leave all other settings blank Click Create repository Copy the HTTPS URL it gives you (e.g. https://github.com/yourname/myblog.git) Initially Push Your Hugo Blog to GitHub Locate your blog folder and record the path \u0026ndash; you\u0026rsquo;ll use this a lot. Open a terminal and run cd followed by the path to you blog folder. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example using myblog:\ncd /home/dan/Documents/website/myblog Now run this in terminal, replacing the url with the HTTPS URL you obtained from your new GitHub repository. This sets the remote and branch; which allows you to sync changes made on you local blog files to you GitHub repo.\ngit init git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit\u0026#34; git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/myblog.git git branch -M main git push -u origin main You’ll only need to set the remote and branch once, using the terminal.\nAfter setting the remote and branch, from now on you can edit your local files, then push the changes to GitHub by committing manually using VS Code. You\u0026rsquo;ll only need to touch the terminal to run your local server from now on!\nHow to Update Your Blog to GitHub Manually Here\u0026rsquo;s the process you will follow from now on to make edits to your blog and push the changes to your GitHub repo. After that, we\u0026rsquo;ll use Netlify to publish live.\nOpen up a post in VS Code, edit the content (just add a few words) and save it. Now, on the pane on the left hand side of the screen, select the Source Control tab. See image below. Next, you should see the change you just made (and any other changes you\u0026rsquo;ve made as well) listed under the Changes dropdown. Click the + button to Stage Changes. There is can also an option to Stage All Changes that appears if you hover over the Changes title. Doing this pushes you changes to the repo dropdown, called myblog Git in this excerise. To commit the changes and push them to you GitHub repo, enter a name for your commit by describing the changes you made. Click Publish Branch. This button will now appear as Commit the next time you wish to push a change to GitHub. Finally, click Sync Changes. Your edits have now been synced to the GitHub repo. Now that you know how to make edits you\u0026rsquo;re now ready to publish you blog live!\nDeploy Your Blog on Netlify Now let’s get it online with Netlify.\nLog into Netlify Click Add new project then Import an existing project Choose GitHub and, if requested, authorize Netlify to access your account Select your repository (ex. myblog). Remmeber, the GitHub repo must be public. It is possible to set this to private as well, however we won\u0026rsquo;t go over that today. Configure the build settings: Build command: hugo Publish directory: public Click Deploy Site Wait a minute or two while Netlify builds your blog. When it’s done, you’ll get a public URL like:\nhttps://your-site-name.netlify.app\nOpen the link in your browser. Congrats — your blog is live!\nTip: You can rename your site under Site Settings \u0026gt; Domain Management in Netlify.\nUpdate Your baseURL in hugo.yaml To make sure links work properly on the live site, update the baseURL parameter in your configuration file.\nOpen hugo.yaml in VS Code\nChange:\nbaseURL: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\nto:\nbaseURL: \u0026quot;https://your-site-name.netlify.app/\u0026quot;\nFrom now on you can save your changes in VS Code, stage your changes, and push them to GitHub by committing your changes. You can always commit changes via the terminal, however I recommend using the VS Code interface as it\u0026rsquo;s easier for beginners to use.\nInsert image of staging an committing\nOnce you’ve commited, you will see a Sync option appear. Click sync. Netlify will automatically rebuild your site with the updated link structure. Refresh your browser to see your update. How cool is that?\nSo cool!\nOptional: Add a Custom Domain\nWant a custom domain like mycoolblog.com?\nPurchase a domain from a registrar (e.g., Namecheap or Google Domains). Or you can just use Netlify to purchase a domain, here\u0026rsquo;s how………. Your blog url will change automatically.\nIf you buy your domain outside of Netlify you must do the following. In Netlify, go to Site Settings \u0026gt; Domain Management \u0026gt; Add Custom Domain.\nFollow the steps to point your domain to Netlify.\nRecap\nYou just: Created a GitHub repo and pushed your Hugo blog code Connected GitHub to Netlify to publish your site Updated your Hugo configuration (Optionally) set a custom domain\nYour blog is now live and ready to share with the world!\nComing Up Next\nIn Part 4, we’ll cover how to write blog posts using Markdown, including: Headers, bold, italic Code blocks and inline code Links, images, and blockquotes\nHave a question or want to show off your blog? 💬 Send us a message — we’d love to see what you’re working on!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/tutorials/blog/create-a-free-blog-tutorial/part3-publish-blog-live/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"create-a-free-blog--part-3\"\u003eCreate-a-Free-Blog — Part 3\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWelcome back!

Grab a drink \u0026ndash; today we’re going to get hands-on and generate your blog locally using Hugo, a fast and modern static site generator. This means your blog won’t be live on the internet just yet \u0026ndash; we’ll get there in Part 3.\nWe’ll install Hugo, pick a theme, create your first post, and preview your blog in your browser.\nIf you missed the first post, see Part 1: Create a Clean Zero-Ad Blog for Free.\nWhat You\u0026rsquo;ll Need A computer with a stable internet connection (Windows, macOS, or Linux) A terminal or command line tool (pre-installed on all operating systems) A code editor \u0026ndash; we recommend Visual Studio Code, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t have this already, we\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to install it. What is Hugo? Hugo is a free, open-source static site generator written in Go. It turns plain text files written in Markdown into a complete, fast-loading blog or website. Unlike platforms like WordPress, Hugo creates static files (called HTML, CSS and JavaScript(JS)) that are easy to host and maintain.\nHTML, CSS and JS are the three foundational languages used to create websites.\nHugo makes creating a blog easy by generating most of the above files for you. You only really need to worry about creating posts (more to come on that) \u0026ndash; however, you can customize your blog using these languages as much as you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with. We won\u0026rsquo;t be touching on them much in these tutorials.\nBenefits of using Hugo:\nSuper fast page loads No databases to manage Perfect for learners, writers, or developers Completely free and ad-free Installing Hugo and Git We’ll guide you through installing Hugo for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need Git, which is required to install themes.\nWindows Setup Open PowerShell as Administrator\nRight-click PowerShell and choose Run as Administrator Install Scoop (a package manager)\nFirst you must install a package manager. I recommend Scoop, an open-source package manager. In Powershell, enter the following code and press Enter. Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser irm get.scoop.sh | iex When prompted, type Y and press Enter. Install Hugo Extended\nNext run the following: scoop install hugo-extended Verify Installation\nHugo should now be installed. To verify the installation, type the following: hugo version You should see this output: hugo v0.xx.x-XXXXXXX+extended windows/amd64 Install Git\nDownload Git from git-scm.com/download/win and run the installer \u0026ndash; Git is what lets you use Hugo themes for your website. macOS Setup Install Homebrew (if you don’t have it)\nFirst you must install a package manager. Homebrew is the most common package manager on macOS. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have it installed already, first, open your terminal and paste the following command: /bin/bash -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026#34; Install Hugo and Git\nIn your terminal, run the following to install both Hugo and Git at once. Git is what allows you to install Hugo themes for your site. brew install hugo git Check Hugo Version\nHugo and Git should now be installed. To verify the Hugo installation, type the following: hugo version You should see this output: hugo v0.xx.x+extended darwin/arm64 (or amd64) Linux (Linux Mint 22.1 example) Commands may vary depending on your distribution. We here at LearnTechCafe use Linux Mint 22.1.\nMinty!\nDownload the latest Hugo Extended release\nVisit the Hugo Releases Page Download the latest extended version of the following file to your Downloads folder: hugo_extended_0.xx.x_Linux-64bit.tar.gz Extract and Install\nExtract the file from your Downloads folder and install Hugo by running the following: cd ~/Downloads tar -xzf hugo_extended_0.xx.x_Linux-64bit.tar.gz sudo mv hugo /usr/local/bin/ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hugo Verify Installation\nHugo should now be installed. To verify the installation, type the following: hugo version You should see this output: hugo v0.xx.x+extended linux/amd64 Install Git\nNow install Git by running the following. Git is what lets you install themes in your Hugo website. sudo apt install git Install Visual Studio Code From here on out, the same instructions apply to all operating systems.\nIf you don’t already have a code editor, download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It’s lightweight, beginner-friendly, and works across all major platforms.\nCreate Your Hugo Site Now that Hugo is installed, let\u0026rsquo;s create your blog!\nOpen your terminal and run:\nhugo new site myblog --format yaml You can replace myblog with any name you like \u0026ndash; typically, the name of your blog (no spaces). In this tutorial, we will continue to use the name myblog. The --format yaml portion is optional. It changes the default configuration file from hugo.toml to hugo.yaml, which is generally easier to read. In the terminal, you should see something like the following:\nTip: Note the second line which says Your New Hugo site was created in.... Remember this folder location \u0026ndash; this is where your new site folder is stored.\nNavigate to your new folder and explore the structure. This is the root folder and contains the structure of your entire blog \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;ll store your theme, content, images, etc. You’ll see folders like content, themes, and the configuration file, hugo.yaml.\nYou can optionally move your root folder to another location, just do not remove the content within it.\nThe folder structure should look like the following:\nmyblog/ ├── archetypes │ └── default.md ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── hugo.yaml ├── i18n ├── layouts ├── static └── themes Pick and Install a Hugo Theme Now for the fun part \u0026ndash; choosing a theme for your blog! Hugo offers dozens of free themes maintained by open-source developers.\nBrowse Hugo themes and explore designs. We recommend PaperMod \u0026ndash; it’s a solid option for a clean, modern blog, and is what LearnTechCafe uses. This is what we\u0026rsquo;ll be using for this tutorial. To Install PaperMod: Note: similar instructions apply to all Hugo themes. Just go to Hugo themes, click the theme you want, and look for a link to that theme\u0026rsquo;s GitHub Repository (Repo).\nVisit the PaperMod GitHub Repo Click the green \u0026lt;\u0026gt; Code button and select Download ZIP Unzip the file Copy the entire unzipped folder into your Hugo site’s themes directory It will be called something like hugo-PaperMod-master. Rename this folder to exactly PaperMod (capitalization matters). In your root folder should now see:\nmyblog ├── archetypes │ └── default.md ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── hugo.yaml ├── i18n ├── layouts ├── static └── themes └── PaperMod Edit Configuration File to Recognize Theme You\u0026rsquo;re almost ready to write your first post! All that\u0026rsquo;s left is to make sure your configuration file points to your theme.\nOpen VS Code, then drag your root folder into the Explorer pane (see image below for an example of what it should look like). This will let you see your entire blog folder in VS Code. Open up the configuration file, hugo.yaml. I recommend editing the baseURL to be \u0026quot;\u0026quot;. We\u0026rsquo;ll come back to this in Part 3. Each blue text followed by a colon is called a parameter, which controls various parts of the site. The text following it, after the space, is called the value for that parameter.\nFinally, type a new parameter called theme and set the value to PaperMod. This tells Hugo which theme to use. If you don\u0026rsquo;t do this, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to run or view your site. Save. Create Your First Post Time to write a basic post to see your blog in action. Back in the terminal, generate a new post file by running:\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md This creates a draft post in content/posts/my-first-post.md. The posts folder will contain all your posts \u0026ndash; you can always add subfolders to break up your post structure as you get more comfortable with Hugo.\nLocate and open your first post file in VS Code and:\nChange draft: true to draft: false. By default, a new post is considered a draft and is labelled as draft: true. This value must be changed to draft: false in order to be published live.\nThe front matter is the information that is pre-populated at the top of the file, between the two --- lines. Add some test content under the front matter. Just a sentence or two will do for now. Run Your Blog Locally Now let\u0026rsquo;s see your blog! To preview your site run:\nhugo server Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:1313. You should see your blog running locally on your computer! Try clicking on the post to open it up in a new page. You\u0026rsquo;ll also see a niftly toggle button near the top of the page which switchs your site between light and dark mode.\nOutstanding! To stop running your blog locally, either close the terminal, or, click CTRL + C twice to stop while keeping the terminal open.\nRecap You just:\nInstalled Hugo and Git Created your blog site folder Installed a theme Created your first post Ran the blog locally in your browser Nice work! From now on, you can preview your content and changes live in your browser. Play around with updating some content in your post.\nComing Up Next In Part 3 of our Create-a-Free-Blog Tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through how to publish your blog live using GitHub and Netlify. We\u0026rsquo;ll get into using Markdown to write and customize you posts in Part 4.\nThis blog is still super-new, so we don’t have an email list (yet).

It’s all about helping you build your own blog for free, with no ads, and no trials. The only “catch”? You need a willingness to learn, using an open-source tool called Hugo (more on that later). So follow along with this series and build yourself a clean, professional website to get your thoughts and ideas out there for the world to see, all while saving you money.\nWhy Start a Blog? Have you always wanted to start a blog, just to get your thoughts out there? Maybe you want to:\nBuild a personal portfolio Write and share book reviews Share your tech journey Create a personal, digital workspace Document and track caffeine consumption publicly\nOr just learn how to build a website in general? If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever gone to Google and typed something like:\n\u0026ldquo;How to start a blog for free?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Best free blogging platform\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Is WordPress free?\u0026rdquo; Then you\u0026rsquo;ve probably run into the same problem I did. That is: Most \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; blogging options aren\u0026rsquo;t really free.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the Catch with Most \u0026ldquo;Free\u0026rdquo; Blogging Platforms? These \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; platforms either have:\nA limited-time trial Reduced features Visually displeasing ads Ugly branding you can\u0026rsquo;t remove Or all of the above To remove some of these features, you need to pay to upgrade.\nSure, platforms such as WordPress, Wix or Squarespace let you setup a blog with ease. However, with this ease, comes a cost \u0026ndash; either in money, performace, or control. Yes, many people use these services. And that\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine! You can get a professional blog up and running quickly with any one of these services.\nBut what if I told you that\u0026hellip;\nYou Can Build a Free Blog Not only that \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s also:\nCompletely ad-free Privacy-friendly and ethical Lightning fast Fully under your control \u0026ndash; no company can take down your posts Did I mentioned it\u0026rsquo;s 100% free?

This is the only piece of the whole puzzle that costs money \u0026ndash; if you wish to have a custom domain (like learntechcafe.com), you must purchase it. Luckily, this is optional. If you walk through this process with us, we\u0026rsquo;ll set you up with a live, free domain \u0026ndash; you just can\u0026rsquo;t customize it unless you buy your own domain.

It\u0026rsquo;s not drag-and-drop like WordPress, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you won\u0026rsquo;t be required to become a hardcore developer, or drown in code. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep it simple.\nBy the end of this series, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a fully functional blog that:\nLoads super fast compared to most paid blog platforms out there Doesn\u0026rsquo;t track or advertise to your readers Costs you nothing but a domain name (optional) Belongs 100% to you Why We\u0026rsquo;re Doing This This is what LearnTechCafe is all about: building digital skills on a budget, in a fun, stress-free and beginner-friendly way!\n$$$!\nComing Up Next In Part 2 of our Create-a-Free-Blog Tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through installing Hugo and building your first blog post!
