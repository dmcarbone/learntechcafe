[{"content":"Create-a-Free-Blog \u0026ndash; Part 2 Today we’re going to get hands-on and generate your blog locally using Hugo, a fast and modern static site generator. This means your blog won’t be live on the internet just yet \u0026ndash; we’ll get there in Part 3.\nWe’ll install Hugo, pick a theme, create your first post, and preview your blog in your browser.\nIf you missed the first post, see Part 1: Create a Clean Zero-Ad Blog for Free.\nWhat You\u0026rsquo;ll Need A computer with a stable internet connection (Windows, macOS, or Linux) A terminal or command line tool (pre-installed on all operating systems) A code editor \u0026ndash; we recommend Visual Studio Code, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t have this already, we\u0026rsquo;ll show you how to install it. What is Hugo? Hugo is a free, open-source static site generator written in Go. It turns plain text files written in Markdown into a complete, fast-loading blog or website. Unlike platforms like WordPress, Hugo creates static files (called HTML, CSS and JavaScript(JS)) that are easy to host and maintain.\nHTML, CSS and JS are the three foundational languages used to create websites.\nHugo makes creating a website easy by generating most of the above files for you. You only really need to worry about creating posts \u0026ndash; however, you can customize your blog using the languages as much as you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with, but we won\u0026rsquo;t be touching on them much in these tutorials.\nBenefits of using Hugo:\nSuper fast page loads No databases to manage Perfect for learners, writers, or developers Completely free and ad-free Installing Hugo and Git We’ll guide you through installing Hugo for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You’ll also need Git, which is required to install themes.\nWindows Setup Open PowerShell as Administrator\nRight-click PowerShell and choose Run as Administrator Install Scoop (a package manager)\nFirst you must install a package manager. I recommend Scoop, an open-source package manager. In Powershell, enter the following code and press Enter. Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser irm get.scoop.sh | iex When prompted, type Y and press Enter. Install Hugo Extended\nNext run the following: scoop install hugo-extended Verify Installation\nHugo should now be installed. To verify the installation, type the following: hugo version You should see this output: hugo v0.xx.x-XXXXXXX+extended windows/amd64 Install Git\nDownload Git from git-scm.com/download/win and run the installer \u0026ndash; Git is what lets you use Hugo themes for your website. macOS Setup Install Homebrew (if you don’t have it)\nFirst you must install a package manager. Homebrew is the most common package manager on macOS. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have it installed already, first, open your terminal and paste the following command: /bin/bash -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026#34; Install Hugo and Git\nIn your terminal, run the following to install both Hugo and Git at once. Git is what allows you to install Hugo themes for your site. brew install hugo git Check Hugo Version\nHugo and Git should now be installed. To verify the Hugo installation, type the following: hugo version You should see this output: hugo v0.xx.x+extended darwin/arm64 (or amd64) Linux (Linux Mint 22.1 example) Commands may vary depending on your distribution. We here at LearnTechCafe use Linux Mint 22.1.\nMinty!\nDownload the latest Hugo Extended release\nVisit the Hugo Releases Page Download the latest extended version of the following file to your Downloads folder: hugo_extended_0.xx.x_Linux-64bit.tar.gz Extract and Install\nExtract the file from your Downloads folder and install Hugo by running the following: cd ~/Downloads tar -xzf hugo_extended_0.xx.x_Linux-64bit.tar.gz sudo mv hugo /usr/local/bin/ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hugo Verify Installation\nHugo should now be installed. To verify the installation, type the following: hugo version You should see this output: hugo v0.xx.x+extended linux/amd64 Install Git\nNow install Git by running the following. Git is what lets you install themes in your Hugo website. sudo apt install git Install Visual Studio Code From here on out, the same instructions apply to all operating systems.\nIf you don’t already have a code editor, download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It’s lightweight, beginner-friendly, and works across all major platforms.\nCreate Your Hugo Site Now that Hugo is installed, let\u0026rsquo;s create your blog!\nOpen your terminal and run:\nhugo new site myblog --format yaml You can replace myblog with any name you like \u0026ndash; typically, the name of your blog (no spaces). In this tutorial, we will continue to use the name myblog. The --format yaml portion is optional. It changes the default configuration file from hugo.toml to hugo.yaml, which is generally easier to read. In the terminal, you should see something like the following:\nTip: Note the second line which says Your New Hugo site was created in.... Remember this folder location \u0026ndash; this is where your new site files are stored.\nNavigate to your new folder and explore the structure. This is the root folder and contains the structure of your entire blog \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;ll store your theme, content, images, etc. You’ll see folders like content, themes, and the configuration file, hugo.yaml.\nYou can optionally move your root folder to another location, just do not remove the content within it.\nThe folder structure should look like the following:\nmyblog/ ├── archetypes │ └── default.md ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── hugo.yaml ├── i18n ├── layouts ├── static └── themes Pick and Install a Hugo Theme Now for the fun part \u0026ndash; choosing a theme for your blog! Hugo offers dozens of free themes maintained by open-source developers.\nBrowse Hugo themes and explore designs. We recommend PaperMod \u0026ndash; it’s a solid option for a clean, modern blog, and is what LearnTechCafe uses. This is what we\u0026rsquo;ll be using for this tutorial. To Install PaperMod: Note: similar instructions apply to all Hugo themes. Just go to Hugo themes, click the theme you want, and look for a link to that theme\u0026rsquo;s GitHub Repository (Repo).\nVisit the PaperMod GitHub Repo Click the green \u0026lt;\u0026gt; Code button and select Download ZIP Unzip the file Copy the entire unzipped folder into your Hugo site’s themes directory It will be called something like hugo-PaperMod-master. Rename this folder to exactly PaperMod (capitalization matters). In your root folder should now see:\nmyblog ├── archetypes │ └── default.md ├── assets ├── content ├── data ├── hugo.yaml ├── i18n ├── layouts ├── static └── themes └── PaperMod Edit Configuration File to Recognize Theme You\u0026rsquo;re almost ready to write your first post! All that\u0026rsquo;s left is to make sure your configuration file points to your theme.\nOpen VS Code, then drag your root folder into the Explorer pane (see image below for an example of what it should look like). This will let you see your entire blog folder in VS Code. Open up the configuration file, hugo.yaml. I recommend editing the baseURL to be \u0026quot;\u0026quot;. We\u0026rsquo;ll come back to this in Part 3. Each blue text followed by a colon is called a parameter, which controls various parts of the site. The text follows it, after the space, is called the value for that parameter.\nFinally, add a new parameter called theme and set the value to PaperMod. This tells Hugo which theme to use. If you don\u0026rsquo;t do this, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to run or view your site. Save. Create Your First Post Time to write a basic post to see your blog in action. Back in the terminal, generate a new post file by running:\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md This creates a draft post in content/posts/my-first-post.md. The posts folder will contain all your posts \u0026ndash; you can always add subfolders to break up your post structure as you get more comfortable with Hugo.\nLocate and open your first post file in VS Code and:\nChange draft: true to draft: false. By default, a new post is considered a draft and is labelled as draft: true. This value must be changed to draft: false in order to be published live.\nThe front matter is the information that is pre-populated at the top of the file, between the two --- lines. Add some test content under the front matter. Just a sentence or two will do for now. Run Your Blog Locally Now let\u0026rsquo;s see your blog! To preview your site run:\nhugo server Open your browser and visit: http://localhost:1313. You should see your blog running locally on your computer! Try clicking on the post to open it up in a new page.\nOutstanding! To stop running your blog locally, either close the terminal, or, click CTRL + C twice to keep the terminal open.\nRecap You just:\nInstalled Hugo and Git Created your blog site folder Installed a theme Created your first post Ran the blog locally in your browser Nice work! From now on, you can preview your content and changes live in your browser.\nComing Up Next In Part 3 of our Create-a-Free-Blog Tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through how to publish your blog live using GitHub and Netlify.\nThis blog is still super-new, so we don’t have an email list (yet).

It’s all about helping you build your own blog for free, with no ads, and no trials. The only “catch”? You need a willingness to learn, using an open-source tool called Hugo (more on that later). So follow along with this series and build yourself a clean, professional website to get your thoughts and ideas out there for the world to see, all while saving you money.\nWhy Start a Blog? Have you always wanted to start a blog, just to get your thoughts out there? Maybe you want to:\nBuild a personal portfolio Write and share book reviews Share your tech journey Create a personal, digital workspace Document and track caffeine consumption publicly\nOr just learn how to build a website in general? If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever gone to Google and typed something like:\n\u0026ldquo;How to start a blog for free?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Best free blogging platform\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Is WordPress free?\u0026rdquo; Then you\u0026rsquo;ve probably run into the same problem I did. That is: Most \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; blogging options aren\u0026rsquo;t really free.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the Catch with Most \u0026ldquo;Free\u0026rdquo; Blogging Platforms? These \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; platforms either have:\nA limited-time trial Reduced features Visually displeasing ads Ugly branding you can\u0026rsquo;t remove Or all of the above To remove some of these features, you need to pay to upgrade.\nSure, platforms such as WordPress, Wix or Squarespace let you setup a blog with ease. However, with this ease, comes a cost \u0026ndash; either in money, performace, or control. Yes, many people use these services. And that\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine! You can get a professional blog up and running quickly with any one of these services.\nBut what if I told you that\u0026hellip;\nYou Can Build a Free Blog Not only that \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s also:\nCompletely ad-free Privacy-friendly and ethical Lightning fast Fully under your control \u0026ndash; no company can take down your posts Did I mentioned it\u0026rsquo;s 100% free? We\u0026rsquo;re here to tell you that this is not only possible, but completely doable, even for beginners! There are other blogging solutions available, especially if you want to save money, increase performance, and have much greater control over your blog \u0026ndash; as long as you\u0026rsquo;re curious and willing to get hands-on and learn how to build and take control of your own blog. We\u0026rsquo;re here to show you one of those solutions.\nWhat You\u0026rsquo;ll Learn in this Tutorial Series We\u0026rsquo;ll teach you how to use four main tools to build your blogging website.\nHugo \u0026ndash; A free static site generator to create your website and site content using simple code. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, it creates most of the code for you! Visual Studio Code \u0026ndash; A free software program for you to view and edit your code GitHub \u0026ndash; A place to store your site content and code for free Netlify \u0026ndash; A service that hosts your site online, for free Bonus \u0026ndash; We\u0026rsquo;ll also show you how to purchase a custom domain using Netlify. *ZZZT Purchase a custom domain?\nYes, A.B.A2, purchase. This is the only piece of the whole puzzle that costs money \u0026ndash; if you wish to have a custom domain (like learntechcafe.com), you must purchase it. Luckily, this is optional. If you walk through this process with us, we\u0026rsquo;ll set you up with a live, free domain \u0026ndash; you just can\u0026rsquo;t customize it unless you buy your own domain. We\u0026rsquo;ll get to that later in this series!\nWith the above tools, you\u0026rsquo;ll:\nWrite your posts in simple Markdown — a lightweight formatting language that makes writing and styling content easy Publish your posts to GitHub Automatically deploy your posts to the web, instantly. It\u0026rsquo;s actually really cool once you get it running! Yes it takes some learning \u0026ndash; but no, it\u0026rsquo;s not overwhelming. It\u0026rsquo;s not drag-and-drop like WordPress, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you won\u0026rsquo;t be required to become a hardcore developer, or drown in code. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep it simple.\nBy the end of this series, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a fully functional blog that:\nLoads super fast compared to most paid blog platforms out there Doesn\u0026rsquo;t track or advertise to your readers Costs you nothing but a domain name (optional) Belongs 100% to you Why We\u0026rsquo;re Doing This This is what LearnTechCafe is all about: building digital skills on a budget, in a fun, stress-free and beginner-friendly way!\n$$$!\nComing Up Next In Part 2 of our Create-a-Free-Blog Tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through installing Hugo and building your first blog post!

These \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; platforms either have:\nA limited-time trial Reduced features Visually displeasing ads Ugly branding you can\u0026rsquo;t remove Or all of the above To remove some of these features, you need to pay to upgrade.\nSure, platforms such as WordPress, Wix or Squarespace let you setup a blog with ease. However, with this ease, comes a cost \u0026ndash; either in money, performace, or control. Yes, many people use these services. And that\u0026rsquo;s perfectly fine! You can get a professional blog up and running quickly with any one of these services.\nBut what if I told you that\u0026hellip;\nYou Can Build a Free Blog Not only that \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s also:\nCompletely ad-free Privacy-friendly and ethical Lightning fast Fully under your control \u0026ndash; no company can take down your posts Did I mentioned it\u0026rsquo;s 100% free? We\u0026rsquo;re here to tell you that this is not only possible, but completely doable, even for beginners! There are other blogging solutions available, especially if you want to save money, increase performance, and have much greater control over your blog \u0026ndash; as long as you\u0026rsquo;re curious and willing to get hands-on and learn how to build and take control of your own blog. We\u0026rsquo;re here to show you one of those solutions.\nWhat You\u0026rsquo;ll Learn in this Tutorial Series We\u0026rsquo;ll teach you how to use four main tools to build your blogging website.\nHugo \u0026ndash; A free static site generator to create your website and site content using simple code. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, it creates most of the code for you! Visual Studio Code \u0026ndash; A free software program for you to view and edit your code GitHub \u0026ndash; A place to store your site content and code for free Netlify \u0026ndash; A service that hosts your site online, for free Bonus \u0026ndash; We\u0026rsquo;ll also show you how to purchase a custom domain using Netlify. *ZZZT Purchase a custom domain?\nYes, A.B.A2, purchase. This is the only piece of the whole puzzle that costs money \u0026ndash; if you wish to have a custom domain (like learntechcafe.com), you must purchase it. Luckily, this is optional. If you walk through this process with us, we\u0026rsquo;ll set you up with a live, free domain \u0026ndash; you just can\u0026rsquo;t customize it unless you buy your own domain. We\u0026rsquo;ll get to that later in this series!\nWith the above tools, you\u0026rsquo;ll:\nWrite your posts in simple Markdown — a lightweight formatting language that makes writing and styling content easy Publish your posts to GitHub Automatically deploy your posts to the web, instantly. It\u0026rsquo;s actually really cool once you get it running! Yes it takes some learning \u0026ndash; but no, it\u0026rsquo;s not overwhelming. It\u0026rsquo;s not drag-and-drop like WordPress, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry, you won\u0026rsquo;t be required to become a hardcore developer, or drown in code. We\u0026rsquo;ll keep it simple.\nBy the end of this series, you\u0026rsquo;ll have a fully functional blog that:\nLoads super fast compared to most paid blog platforms out there Doesn\u0026rsquo;t track or advertise to your readers Costs you nothing but a domain name (optional) Belongs 100% to you Why We\u0026rsquo;re Doing This This is what LearnTechCafe is all about: building digital skills on a budget, in a fun, stress-free and beginner-friendly way!\n$$$!\nComing Up Next In Part 2 of our Create-a-Free-Blog Tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through installing Hugo and building your first blog post!
